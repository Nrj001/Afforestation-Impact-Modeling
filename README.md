# Afforestation-Impact-Modeling
Tree plantation projects often lack clear, data-backed insights into how much COâ‚‚ can be captured over time. This makes it difficult to plan effectively, attract funding, or measure long-term climate benefits.

ðŸ’¡ Solution
Gathered species-specific growth rates, biomass carbon content, and survival rates.

Developed a Python model to simulate tree growth and estimate carbon capture.

Created visual outputs (graphs & charts) to compare sequestration across species.

Designed the framework to be expandable with new datasets for regional adaptation.
