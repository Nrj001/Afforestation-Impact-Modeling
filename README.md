# Afforestation Impact Modeling Project

This project simulates the CO₂ sequestration potential of three native tree species over a 20-year period using Python.

## Contents
- `data/species_growth_data.csv`: Input dataset with tree species parameters
- `scripts/sequestration_model.py`: Python script to run the simulation and generate plots
- `output/charts/`: Folder where output visualizations are saved

## How to Run
1. Install required packages: pandas, matplotlib
2. Run the script from `scripts/`:
   ```
   python sequestration_model.py
   ```

## Output
- A line chart showing estimated CO₂ capture per species over 20 years (in tons)

- This project, developed as part of the 1M1B Green Skills Virtual Internship, focuses on estimating the long-term carbon sequestration potential of newly planted trees. Using Python-based simulation modeling and real-world tree growth data, it projects CO₂ capture over a 10–20 year period for various species and planting strategies. The model aims to help institutions, policymakers, and communities make informed afforestation decisions backed by quantitative data.
